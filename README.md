## Description

  You can take a book from library or a film from Netflix, but I've always wondered, why can't I get a pet for a short period of time, like few hours or a day, just to play with it. We all love pets, but not all of us have enough time to take care of it. With this application you can get a kitten or a puppy or, perhaps, spider for a limited period, and have a good time with it.

  You can choose pet/pets you like, and they will be delivered just to your place. After that you can pet it, hug it or do whatever you want (within user licence and additional rulles set by owners).

  Some pets may be even purchused after your play session, if this option is set in it's profile, in case you will fill attached to it ^^.

  Pets may be chosen from the veriaty of our partners: zoo-shops, or animal-shelters, ot even individual owners.
